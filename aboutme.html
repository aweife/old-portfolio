						<h1>About me</h1>
					</header>
					<span class="image main"><img src="images/mugshot1.jpg" alt="" /></span>
					<p>My name is Ang Wei Feng and I am 22 years old this year.</p>
					<p>Since young, I have always been playing games on my computer which is something my parents
						disapprove of. Most of my early childhood consisted of web browser games like Runescape,
						Adventure Quest, mini flash games at <a href="http://www.y8.com/">www.y8.com</a> and many other
						similar sites and games from facebook. I also enjoyed playing GTA and Monster Hunter on a PSP,
						as well as Halo on XBox. As I grew up, I moved on to F2P MMORPG such as Maplestory, Grand Chase,
						Dragon Nest, DotA and League of Legends. As you can see, most of these games had two things in
						common: they were all multiplayer and free-to-play.</p>
					<p>Yes, I did not know of many popular AAA-game single-player titles until I've started in my
						course. I was confused when my course mates exclaimed things like, "What! You never heard of
						Assassin's Creed?" or "Man, how can you not played The Last of Us/Far Cry/Skyrim before?" I
						thought I had played many games where, in fact, I was swimming in a very small pond and there
						are oceans of games out there.</p>
					<p>There are many similar people like me out there, oblivious to the mountains of games they haven't
						heard of. I aim to captivate
						the hearts of these people all around the world and provide them with endless entertainment
						value.</p>
					<hr class="major">
					<h2>A little anecdote</h2>
					<p>Someone once asked me this question:</p>
					<blockquote>So, what is game development all about? What is it you really do?</blockquote>
					<p>A correct answer would be along the lines of, "Well, first, the designers think of a game concept
						and make a design document. The artists will draw some concept art before moving on to 3D
						modelling and animations. Lastly, the programmers use a game engine to compile everything into a
						game".</p>
					<p>But that is a boring way to tell someone about game development which they may not understand.
						Instead, here is an interesting take on it:</p>
					<div class="box">
						<p>Imagine a game is a beautiful picture and it is made up of many jigsaw puzzle pieces.</p>
						<p>A <i>designer</i> is someone who <b>designs</b> the story behind the picture, as well as the
							size and complexity of it. An <i>artist</i> then <b>create</b> each and every individual
							piece and lastly, a <i>programmer</i> will <b>assemble</b> the pieces into a finished jigsaw
							puzzle. Every role is equally important to ensure that what we end up making is a pretty
							picture that art collectors will buy.</p>
						<p>Without designers, what you will have is a messy and confusing picture. Without artists and
							you may have a blank jigsaw puzzle or a picture drawn by a five year-old. And without
							programmers, well, you will have some nice looking puzzle pieces.</p>
